Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/2d-Geo-starter](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/2d-Geo-starter)

**PICK TWO SHAPES**:
  - Circle
  - Right Triangle
  - Equilateral Triangle
  - Regular Pentagon
  - Regular Hexagon
  - Regular Heptagon
  - Regular Octagon
(NOTE: You can NOT do Square or Rectangle)


Directions:
- Define four functions that will *calculate and return*:
    1.  the area of shape 1
    1.  perimeter of shape 1
    1.  area shape 2
    1.  perimeter of shape 2
- The starter code has a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - YOU MUST CALL the functions that return the area of shape 1 and perimeter of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the area and perimeter of shape 1
- The starter code has a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - YOU MUST CALL the functions that return the area of shape 2 and perimeter of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the area and perimeter of shape 2
- Change the label for your first shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (base, height, side 1, side 2, etc)
- The starter code has a button that says "Calculate Shape 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
- Change the label for your second shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
- The starter code has a button that says "Calculate Shape 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
