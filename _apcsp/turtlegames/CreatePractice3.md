### You MUST turn in THREE files for this project:

![Example oval and rectangle](/apcsp\console\ovalRectangle.PNG)

1. Your Python code as a PDF marked with an oval and a rectangle:
  - Use [bakerfranke.github.io/codePrint/](https://bakerfranke.github.io/codePrint/). Tutorial video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13X1RYJmzUXzpP2r11ysqAUzXLZayJkuD/view)
  - Mark with an OVAL the segment of program code that implements the _essential_ algorithm you created for your program that integrates other algorithms and integrates mathematical and/or logical concepts.
  - Mark with a RECTANGLE the segment of program code that represents an abstraction you developed individually on your own.
  - Save your code marked with an oval and a rectangle as a PDF file
  - Turn in your PDF file

1. A screencast recording that demonstrates the app working. ```Your video MUST be smaller than 30MB and MUST be less than 1 minute in length.```
  - Notice that the app just needs to be _working_ it doesn't need to be 100% finished
  - [Screencast Instructions for OBS](https://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsp/scrum/screencastobs)
  - Turn in your MP4 file

1. Written Reflection:
