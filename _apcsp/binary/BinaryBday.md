Working on your own, you will use either paper, Notability, Google Docs, a spreadsheet, a text file, etc.
Convert the number of the day you were born to binary, then continue by converting the following nine numbers to binary. You will convert a total of ten numbers from decimal to binary.

For example...
  - if your birthday is September 1st, you will convert numbers 1 through 10 to binary.
  - if your birthday is March 14th, you will convert numbers 14 through 23 to binary.
  - if your birthday is December 31st, you will convert numbers 31 through 40 to binary.


If your birthday is the 31st, you would *start* like this...
```
