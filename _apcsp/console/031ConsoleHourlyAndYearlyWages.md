You ```MUST validate the input using Try/Except``` or the program will crash.

You can learn how to validate user input [here](https://www.101computing.net/number-only/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)

- Tell the user "I can calculate your 1) Hourly Wage given a Yearly Wage OR 2) Yearly Wage given a Hourly Wage"
- Collect the user input and validate that they pressed 1 or 2
- (I will give steps for 1 and you can do 2 on your own)
- Prompt for the Yearly Wage
- Validate that they entered a number >0
- Prompt for how many days per week they work on average
- Validate that they entered a number >0
- Prompt for how many hours per day they work on average
- Validate that they entered a number >0
- Divide the Yearly Wage by the total number of weeks in a year, then divide that by Days Per Week they work, then divide that by the Hours Per Day they work.
- Tell them "The Hourly Wage is roughly $x.xx per hour"
