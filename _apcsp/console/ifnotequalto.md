Python if not equal to

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:


|Equals |if a == b|
|Not Equals	|if a != b|
|Less than	|if a < b|
|Less than or equal to	|if a <= b|
|Greater than	|if a > b|
|Greater than or equal to	|if a >= b|


These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

For example...
```
a = 33
b = 200
if a == b:
  print("variables a and b are equal")
if a != b:
  print("variables a and b are NOT equal")
if a > b:
  print("variable a is greater than b")
if a >= b:
  print("variable a is greater than or equal to b")
if a < b:
  print("variable a is less than b")
if a <= b:
  print("variable a is less than or equal to b")
 ```
