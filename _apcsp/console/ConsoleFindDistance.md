title: Find Distance
---

Create a function named findDistance that requires FOUR arguments: x1, y1, x2, y2

Given the xy coordinates for two points, this function returns the distance between the two points. You will use the [Distance Formula](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-analytic-geometry/hs-geo-distance-and-midpoints/v/distance-formula) from geometry class. You must NOT print inside of the function.

Input &rarr; Output
```
findDistance(1,2,3,4) -> 2.828
findDistance(0,0,0,1) -> 1.0
```

Finally, you MUST create THREE test cases that show the expected result and print the actual result. This must be outside of the function. Here is an example of what ONE test case might look like...

```
Expected findDistance(1,2,3,4) -> 2.828
Actual 2.8284271247461903
```
