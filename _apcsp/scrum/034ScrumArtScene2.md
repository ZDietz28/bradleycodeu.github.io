title: Scrum Art Scene 2
---
This project is to be completed with your assigned group of 3 or more.

Decide if you will be creating a scene that is set in:
- city
- undersea
- farm/country
- outer space

Requirements:

Programmers' first names MUST be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting)

Plan your scene with your group. Plan things that will be drawn in the scene (group of 3 will plan 3 things, group of 4 will plan 4 things). In addition to your 3 or 4 things, you will need a function that creates the background and a function that writes the programmers' first names. Assign jobs.

For *THIS* version you will only draw ONE of each thing in the scene. Only draw one star, one cloud, one fish, etc.

For *THIS* version do NOT worry about random colors or random locations.

Functions MUST be used properly and named with logical names (drawWater, makeSky, randomFish, etc)

Use comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment #draw fish's tail)
