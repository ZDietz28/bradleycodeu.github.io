title: Scrum Art Scene 3
---
This project is to be completed with your assigned group of 3 or more.

Python Turtle Scene v2.2 represents Sprint #2.

Hold a Sprint Planning Meeting with your group.

Plan new things that will be added to the scene (group of 3 will plan 3 new things, group of 4 will plan 4 new things).

Plan things that will be random in the scene (a group of 3 people will plan 9 random things, group of 4 people will plan 12 random things). Some examples of random things are:
- add a randomYellow function that sets the pen color to a random shade of yellow
- add a randomNumberStars function that draws between 20 and 30 stars
- add a randomLocationStars function that moves to turtle to a random x between -400 and 400 and a random y between 0 and 400
- change the old drawStar function so that it makes random sized stars

Select jobs.

Requirements:

- Programmers' first names must be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting)

- Functions must be used properly and named with logical names (randomBlue, drawSky, randomFish, etc)

- Use comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment #draw fish's tail)
