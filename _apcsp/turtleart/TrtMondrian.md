In this project you will create a Mondrian-style Drawing Generator.

### DIRECTIONS

Define a function that will draw ONE Rectangle. (You will use this in the main algorithm below)
  - Create a variable called height set it to 50 multiplied by a small random integer (50 is the grid size)
  - Create a variable called width set it to 50 multiplied by a small random integer
  - Begin fill
  - Draw a rectangle using the height and width variable and 90-deg turns
  - End fill

Main Algorithm:
  - Ask the user, Please type the name of your 1st color (for example, red):
  - Save their answer in a variable named color1
  - Ask the user, Please type the name of your 2nd color (for example, yellow):
  - Save their answer in another variable
  - Ask the user, Please type the name of your 3rd color (for example, blue):
  - Save their answer in another variable
  - Create a for loop
    - Pick up the pen
    - Create a variable called x set it to 50 multiplied by a small random integer
    - Create a variable called y set it to 50 multiplied by a small random integer
    - Go to x, y
    - Randomly set the fill color to either "white", color1, color2, or color3
    - Call your draw one rectangle function
