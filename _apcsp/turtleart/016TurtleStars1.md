Write code that will draw a star with 5 points, 7 points, 8 points, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 points. In other words... I should be able to ask the program to draw something crazy like a 15-pointed star or 16-pointed star.

Define a function named isValidNumber that requires one argument (myNumber) and returns True or False if myNumber is valid. For this project, any integer 5-20 is valid.

1. Ask the user "HOW MANY POINTS: "
1. If user input is not a valid number, print "Not a valid number" and don't draw anything.
1. Your code should use calculations (not x-y coordinates) to draw the shape.
1. Create a for loop.
  1. Inside the for loop you will move forward(100) and turn right(???)
    - right(180/userinput)???
    - right(360/userinput)???
    - right(540/userinput)???
    - right(900/userinput)???
    - There are multiple solutions!

Bronze medal: you can only make stars 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19

Silver medal: you can make stars 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20

Gold medal: can make stars 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 using less than 15 lines of code!!!

NOTE: Notice that 6 points, 12 points, and 18 points are not required.
