---
Write code that will draw stars **WITH NO INTERNAL WALLS**. It will create the outline of a 5-pointed star, 6-pointed, 7-pointed, 8-pointed, etc.

Define a function named isValidNumber that requires one argument (myNumber) and returns True or False if myNumber is valid. For this project, any integer 5-20 is valid.

  - Ask the user "HOW MANY POINTS?"
  - If user input is not a valid number, print "Not a valid number" and don't draw anything.
  - Your code should use calculations (not x-y coodinates) to draw the shape.

I should be able to ask the program to draw something crazy like a 19-pointed star and it will draw it.
