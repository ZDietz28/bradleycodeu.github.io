### This project ```MUST``` be completed as a group of 2 or 3.

You ```CANNOT``` complete this project alone.

Decide if you will be creating an underwater scene, country scene, or city scene

Use bgcolor() to set the background color (NOTE: this is a function, not a method)

You will write code to draw several things in your scene:
  - Group of 2 = draw 4 things by creating 4 functions
  - Group of 3 = draw 6 things by creating 6 functions

Here are some suggested "things" for your scene:

If underwater scene... | If country scene... | If city scene...
---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------
Waves | Sun or Moon (random location) | Cars (random locations)
Bubbles (random locations / sizes) | Ground with hills | Sun or Moon (random location)
Seaweed (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes)
Fish (random locations / sizes) | Trees (random locations / sizes) | Ground with river or ocean waves
Starfish | 	Birds like this [example](/apcsp\turtleart\birdAndBalloons.png) (random locations) | Skyscrapers (random locations / sizes)
Crab or similar (random location) | Barn or similar (random location) | Bridge or similar (random location)

Additional Requirements:
- Create a function called writeNames. Programmers' names MUST be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting). Check out [this example](https://trinket.io/python/52378ec006)
- Functions MUST be used properly and named with logical names (drawWater, makeSky, randomFish, etc)
- Each function MUST have comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment ```# draw fish tail```)
