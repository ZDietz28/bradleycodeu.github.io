Write code that will draw triangle, square, pentagon, etc.

Define a function named isValidNumber that requires one argument (myNumber) and returns True or False if myNumber is valid. For this project, any integer greater than 2 is valid.

ASK THE PLAYER "HOW MANY SIDES?"

If the user input is a valid number, then use calculations (not x-y coodinates) to draw the shape. Otherwise, print "Not a valid number"

I should be able to ask the program to draw something crazy like a 9-sided polygon or 13-sided polygon.
