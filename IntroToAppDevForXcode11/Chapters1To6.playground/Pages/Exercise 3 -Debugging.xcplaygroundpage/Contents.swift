 ## Exercise: Debugging
 
 Tracking down code issues, or _bugs_, is one of the most common uses of the console. As it turns out, programmers spend an awful lot of time dealing with code that doesnâ€™t yet work. If it worked just the way they wanted it to, they wouldnâ€™t still be revising it.

 In this exercise, youâ€™ll be debugging someone elseâ€™s code. Good luck!
 
 Debug the code so that the console shows:
 
`Roses are red`
 
`Violets are blue`

// -------------- ðŸ‘‡ The code that needs fixing is below this line ðŸ‘‡ --------------------


let flower1 = "Roses"
let flower2 = "Violets"

let color1 = "red"
let color2 = "blue"

let firstLine = "\(flower1)s are \\(flower2)"
let secondLine = "\(flower1)s are " + "color2"



print(firstLine + "\\n" + secondLine)
