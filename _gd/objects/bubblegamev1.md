title: Bubble Game v1
---

In this project you will create a simple Javascript / P5.JS clicker game in which you pop bubbles. For example... bubbles start on the ceiling and you must pop them before they hit the floor.

Here are some example games that could be created for this project:

Your first draft should have:

  - a bubble class with at least two attributes
  - a method that moves a bubble AND a method that deletes/changes/adds a bubble when clicked
  - a sound to play when a bubble is popped (or added or whatever makes you win) AND a bad sound to play when a bubble hits the floor (or whatever makes you lose)
  - the background turns red if you lose AND turns green if you win

For Javascript audio, you will do something like this:

<pre>
var bubblePopSound = new Audio("pop.mp3");
bubblePopSound.play();
</pre>
