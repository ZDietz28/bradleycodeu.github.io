title: Multi-page Pizza Site 2
---

For this project you will continue working on your multi-page pizza site with the same group of 2-4 people.

### Each person will ADD ONE NEW PAGE (with an h1, text, and image) to the site.

Add an [HTML comment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) on each page that says the name of the programmer. For example, `<!-- coded by Mr. Riley -->`

The FINAL number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages (add 2 new pages)
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 6 other pages (add 3 new pages)
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 8 other pages (add 4 new pages)

Ideas for "other pages" include: Pizzas, Wings, Pasta, Sides, Desserts, Drinks, Gift Cards, Deals, Our Locations, Our Story, Employment, Kids Club, Nutrition, Food Truck, Birthday Room, Contact Us

## Add CSS

Which type of CSS should you use?
  -   [Inline CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline)
  -   [Internal CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_internal)
  -   [External CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_external)

### Just like you split up the HTML coding work, you should split up the CSS coding work so that each person in the group writes some CSS code.

Use [CSS comments](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/comments-in-css/) to note the name of the programmer that wrote each rule. For example, `/* coded by Mr. Riley */`

Your website MUST have a consistent style across all pages:

  - same navigation system (like a nav bar) on all pages
  - your navigation uses a small (no larger than 100px wide) logo instead of saying "home." The logo is an anchor that links to index.html
  - same colorful background (not black or white) on all pages
  - same colorful text (not black or white) on all pages
  - same link color (not the default blue) on all pages
  - same visited link color (not the default purple) on all pages
  - same solid 2 pixel black border around all images on all pages
  - use a different font in your navigation (not the same as your normal text)
  - use a different text color in your navigation (not the same as your normal text, not black or white)
  - use a different text size in your navigation (not the same as your normal text)
  - use a different background color in your navigation (not the same as the page background, not black or white)
  - use a solid 2 pixel white border around the navigation on all pages
