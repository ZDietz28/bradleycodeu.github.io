In this project you will use what you learned in [Khan Academy Drawing with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics) (how to draw with ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc).

Requirements:

  - Click here to remix the Glitch starter project: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/p5project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/p5project)
  - Add your code inside of the draw() section.
  - Create your own unique drawing with code. Make it something recognizable, not just a blob. For example... a ghost, a skateboarder, a big chungus, etc.
  - Your drawing must combine several shapes: ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc
  - Use mouseX and mouseY to make your drawing follow the mouse pointer around the screen. mouseX and mouseY are built-in variables that are part of p5js. mouseX will give you the current x coordinates of the mouse.
