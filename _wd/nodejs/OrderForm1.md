Create an order form for an online business. It can sell anything you like (anything that is school appropriate). Include images and prices for all items. Use [input type="number"](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_number.asp) so that the customer can order more than one of an item.

Allow the customer to choose from 3 or more LARGE menu items. For example, a customer might order 2 hot dogs, 1 hamburger, and 3 salads.
- Hot dogs
- Hamburgers
- Salads

Sell 3 or more SMALL items. This section is hidden at first. For example, a customer might order 2 french fries, 0 onion rings, and 1 tater tots.
- Fries
- Onion Rings
- Tater Tots

Cut down on clutter by only showing one section at a time. Here are two different ways to do this:

1. Use [W3Schools Form With Multiple Steps](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_form_steps.asp)
2. Use [details and summary](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp) to create collapsible hidden sections (or use [Bootstrap's collapse](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_collapse.asp))


For version 1, your Submit button doesn't need to do anything
