This project uses the following content:

- [Bootstrap 4 Jumbotron](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-jumbotron/)

- [Bootstrap 4 Buttons](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-buttons/)

- [Bootstrap 4 Forms and Inputs](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-forms-and-inputs/)

- [Bootstrap 4 Collapse](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-collapse/)

- [Bootstrap 4 Display and Text Classes](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-display-and-text-classes/)



You will be creating a new version of your club page with a text input for email, a large Display class title, and a large paragraph of info about when/where the club meets. This paragraph will be hidden until the user presses the MORE INFO button.

You MUST have:

1.  a main [container](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-containers "Bootstrap 4 Containers") with everything else inside of it
2.  a [Jumbotron](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-jumbotron "Bootstrap 4 Jumbotron") that contains:
    *   ```ADD``` an h1 (with one of the [Bootstrap display classes](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-display-and-text-classes "Bootstrap 4 Display and Text Classes")) that says the club nameÂ 
    *   logo (you can re-use the one from last fall, if you can find it)
3.  a [Bootstrap row with 3 columns](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-grid "Bootstrap 4 Grid"). Each column contains a photo from the actual club (would be great if you could find Bradley photos... if not, then any photos from Google will do).
4.  two sections (Info section and Sign Up section) on the same line. Hint: [make a row with two columns](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-grid "Bootstrap 4 Grid").
    *   ```ADD``` the info section has a paragraph of info about when/where the club meets and a [Bootstrap collapse](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-collapse "Bootstrap 4 Collapse") that says MORE INFO on the button. The div that you hide/show can just have a paragraph of nonsense.
    *   ```ADD``` the Sign Up section has a [Bootstrap large input type="text"](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-forms-and-inputs "Bootstrap 4 Forms and Inputs") to type your email address and a [Bootstrap button](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-buttons "Bootstrap 4 Buttons") that says SIGN UP
    *   the info section takes up about 60% of the page width and the form takes up about 40% of the page width. Hint: what is 60% of 12? round to the nearest whole number
5.  Give every Bootstrap column sizes for small, medium, and large screens
6.  Use 2 or more [Bootstrap background color classes](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-colors "Bootstrap 4 Colors")
7.  ```ADD``` 2 or more [Bootstrap text color classes](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-colors "Bootstrap 4 Colors")
