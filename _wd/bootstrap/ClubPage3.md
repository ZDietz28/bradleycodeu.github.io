REMIX your previous Bootstrap club page.

For v3.0, the club adviser would like you to make a few changes/additions to the club page. Here are some sketches:

Must have:

- a new logo that has HB (or the B claw) and an item that symbolizes the club (German club = German flag, Anime club = Naruto, etc)
- six or more photos (can be a mix of Bradley photos and Google photos) resized and cropped to be square thumbnails
- six or more [Bootstrap modals](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp) that open when you click a thumbnail and show the full size photo
- a large text section with the club name
- an info section with About Us, Meetings, and Sign Up headings and smaller indented text. The indented text for About Us and Meetings could be real text or [filler text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum).
- a text input and submit button in the Sign Up section
- *** MUST use a Google Font for the About Us, Meetings, and Sign Up headings. Leave the indented text as a normal font. Helpful links: [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/) and [w3schools How To Google Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp)

If you have completed 1 or more Computer Science courses, pick one of the following:

1. only use one image modal, but create [a photo slideshow/carousel](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) with all of the photos on that modal
1. use [collapsibles/accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) to clean up the info section
