Use Bootstrap to create a page for a school club.

You MUST have:

1.  a main [container](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-containers "Bootstrap 4 Containers") with everything else inside of it
2.  a [Jumbotron](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-jumbotron "Bootstrap 4 Jumbotron") that contains:
    *   logo (you can re-use the one from last fall, if you can find it)
3.  a [Bootstrap row with 3 columns](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-grid "Bootstrap 4 Grid"). Each column contains a photo from the actual club (would be great if you could find Bradley photos... if not, then any photos from Google will do).
4.  two sections (Info section and Sign Up section) on the same line. Hint: [make a row with two columns](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-grid "Bootstrap 4 Grid").
    *   the Info section has an h2 that says Info
    *   the Sign Up section has an h2 that says Sign Up
    *   the info section takes up about 60% of the page width and the form takes up about 40% of the page width. Hint: what is 60% of 12? round to the nearest whole number
5.  Give every Bootstrap column sizes for small, medium, and large screens
6.  Use 2 or more [Bootstrap background color classes](/wd/bootstrap/bootstrap-4-colors "Bootstrap 4 Colors")
