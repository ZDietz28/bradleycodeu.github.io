Use Bootstrap to create a page for a school club.

Must have:

- one or more photos from the actual club (would be great if you could get 3 or more Bradley photos)
- a Carousel with images cropped in Photoshop to look like banners (optional: you could have another Carousel with the original uncropped photos)
- a Jumbotron with the club name
- an info section (with info about when the club meets) on the same line as a Form (with an input type="text" to type your email address and a submit button)
- the info section should take up about 60% of the page width and the form should take up about 40% of the page width


Create a Bootstrap page for a real Bradley club.
