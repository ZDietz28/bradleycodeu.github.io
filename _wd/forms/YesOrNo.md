[Here is a demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vw5GDnkJAvt61_dFyai6K1EcWJNqBFt4/view)

Create two huge buttons using the [HTML div tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp), Yes and No buttons

When you hover over them, they change color

When you click Yes it plays a happy sound and when you click No it play a sad sound

For Javascript audio, you will do something similar to this:
```
var bubblePopSound = new Audio("pop.mp3");
bubblePopSound.play();
```
### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...
make it randomly select one of several sounds OR make it cycle through several sounds so that they are played in order.
