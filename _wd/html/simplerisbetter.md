Go to repl.it classroom to begin coding

Create a simple webpage (for a business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc) with:
1.  A Title
1.  Heading (H1)
1.  Three simple details in normal text on three separate lines (motto or slogan, fake phone number, fake building address, fake email, fake store hours, etc)
1.  Use the &lt;center&gt; [center tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp) (both opening and closing tags) to center text on the page. Later, we will learn how to center text using CSS instead.
1.  Upload the logo that you created to repl.it and then use the [img tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) to insert the image into the page
