R2.10 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it to "hello". Use the replace method. <ins>Print the result</ins>

E2.8 The StringBuilder class has a method for reversing a string. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html) Write code to construct a StringBuilder object from a given string (`"desserts"`), call the reverse method followed by the toString method, and <ins>print the result</ins>.
