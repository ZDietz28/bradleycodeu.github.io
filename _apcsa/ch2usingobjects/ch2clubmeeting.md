The school coding club can't decide when to hold their meetings. They agree to create a program to randomly decide their meeting times.

  1.  Where should they meet? Your code will randomly pick either 266 or 267.
  1.  What time should they meet? Your code will randomly pick either 3, 4, or 5.
  1.  What grade will provide snacks? Your code will randomly pick either 9, 10, 11, or 12.
  1.  What should the membership fee be? Your code will randomly pick a number 5 to 15.

Construct an object of the Random class (see [Exercise •• E2.12](https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781119141594/epub/OEBPS/bjeo6_ch02-33.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257)) and invoke an appropriate method to generate a number.

You do not need to construct more than one Random class object. Each time you need to generate a new number just use another method call.
