Summary of Chapters 1 & 2
*/

// 1) Write the import statement for the Rectangle class


// 2) Write the import statement for the Random class


// 3) Write the import statement needed for question 8 (below)


public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// 4) Write MULTIPLE output statements that will produce a smiley face


		// 5) Write a program that constructs three identical square Rectangle objects with
		//    top-left corner (100, 100) and side length 200. Print their starting locations,
		//		apply the grow and translate methods, and print the ending locations again.
		//		The calls to grow and translate should modify the squares so that each
		//		square is half the size of the previous (final sizes should be 200, 100,
		//		and 50) and so that all squares are translated to the origin.


		// 6) Simulate a dice roll. Generate and print a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive.


		// 7) Pick a random room. Generate and print a random integer between 100 and 134, inclusive.


		// 8) Display the day of the week that Mr. Riley's birthday (June 15th) was on this year.


		// 9) Calculate and display the number of letters in the word "Bradley".


		// 10) Finally, visit http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ to get a fancy ASCII art version of your LAST name. For example, Amy Brown would print Brown. Use println statements to print your ASCII art last name.
