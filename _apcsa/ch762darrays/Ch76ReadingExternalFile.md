Read this tutorial about [reading files with Scanner](/apcsa\ch762darrays\readingWithScanner/)

You will use data stored in a text file to fill a 2D array. First, create a file called testData.txt that contains the following integers:

2 6 24 31 14 41 18 11 14 20 17 7 45 33

The dimensions of the 2D array are the first two integers, so the array that will be created and filled is a 2 x 6 (2 rows x 6 columns). Print an error message if ANY of the values is invalid. For example, if you change testData.txt to be "rows=2 and 6columns" then it would print an error message and NOT crash.

Here is a table to help you visualize the 2D array (NOTICE that 2 and 6 are NOT in the 2D array, but describe the number of columns and rows):

|24	|31	|14	|41	|18	|11 |
|14	|20	|17	|7	|45	|33 |

Print the table. Next, print "Average of row 0:" calculate and display the average of the first row. Repeat for the second row.

***IMPORTANT*** I should be able to change the first values to 4 3 and the program will create a 4x3 array and calculate the averages of 3 rows. Here are some other possible first values:

  - 1 12 (1 row, 12 cols)
  - 2 6 (2 rows, 6 cols)
  - 3 4 (3 rows, 4 cols)
  - 4 3 (4 rows, 3 cols)
  - 12 1 (12 rows, 1 cols)

Test Run #1 testData.txt contains: 4 3 24 31 14 41 18 11 14 20 17 7 45 33
```
24 31 14
41 18 11

 7 45 33
Average of row 0: 23.0
Average of row 1: 23.333333333333332
Average of row 2: 17.0
Average of row 3: 28.333333333333332
```
Test Run #2 testData.txt contains: 6 2 24 31 14 41 18 11 14 20 17 7 45 33
```
24 31
14 41

45 33
Average of row 0: 27.5
Average of row 1: 27.5
Average of row 2: 14.5
Average of row 3: 17.0
Average of row 4: 12.0
Average of row 5: 39.0
```
Test Run #3 testData.txt contains: 4kjdfkj 3 24 31 14 41 18 11 14 20 17 7 45 33
```
oops that's not an integer
```
Test Run #4 testData.txt contains: 6 2 24 31 14 41 18 11 14 20 17 7 45 33kjdflkj
```
oops that's not an integer
