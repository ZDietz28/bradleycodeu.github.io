French country names are feminine when they end with the letter e, masculine otherwise, except for the following which are masculine even though they end with e:

  - le Belize
  - le Cambodge
  - le Mexique
  - le Mozambique
  - le Zaïre (or le Zaire)
  - le Zimbabwe

Write a program that reads the French name of a country and adds the article: le for masculine or la for feminine, such as le Canada or la Belgique.

If the country name starts with a vowel, use ```l’``` (for example, l’Afghanistan)

For the following plural country names, use les:

  - les Etats-Unis
  - les Pays-Bas
