Implement a class Student. For the purpose of this exercise, a student has a name and a total quiz score. Supply an appropriate constructor (in which name can be supplied) and methods...
  - getName()
  - addQuiz(int score)
  - getTotalScore()
  - getAverageScore()

To compute the average, you also MUST track the number of quizzes that the student has taken. You are NOT storing the individual quiz scores in a list, instead you are keeping a running total. *Don't forget to check if the number of quizzes equals 0 before calculating the average score. Otherwise, division by zero could occur.*

Supply a StudentTester class that tests all methods. Print your expected results and then the actual results.
