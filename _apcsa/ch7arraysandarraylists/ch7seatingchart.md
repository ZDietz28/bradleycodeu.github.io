When people are in unfamiliar seating arrangement, they generally prefer to maximize their distance from already occupied seats, by occupying the middle of the longest region of empty seats.

Write a program that prompts the user for a number of seats (any integer number >1) and then prints out diagrams similar to the format given below, showing when the seats become filled, one at a time.

For input validation, you may want to use a loop that asks for an integer while NOT scanner hasNextInt()

For example, consider the situation where 8 seats are arranged in one row and are empty.

```
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
```

The first visitor will occupy a middle position:

```
__ __ __ __  X  __ __ __
```

The left region has four empty seats and the right region has three. The next visitor will sit in the middle of the empty left-most region.
```
__ __  X  __  X  __ __ __
```
The right-most region has three empty seats, so the next visitor will go to the middle of the right-most region.
```
__ __  X  __  X  __  X  __
```
This will continue until all seats are filled.

Example Output 1

HINTS:

Use an array of boolean values to indicate whether a seat is occupied.

Pseudocode:

  - Main method
    - get number of seats from user
    - repeat prompt if invalid
    - create empty array of seats
    - for loop that repeats number of seats times
      - call the findSeat method to get the index of the best seat
      - set the best seat to true (aka occupied)
      - call the printArray method
  - static int findSeat requires one argument: array of booleans
    - In your findSeat method, create variables to count:
      - starting index in longest empty region
      - number of seats in longest empty region
      - starting index of current empty region being counted
      - number of seats in current empty region being counted
    - Create nested loops:
      - an outer loop that repeats number of seats times (so that each seat will be checked). if a seat is filled, then just continue to the next seat. If a seat is empty, then save the starting index of current empty region and run the inner loop to find the number of seats in current empty region
      - an inner loop that will count the number of seats in current empty region. It begins at the outer loop index and repeats while less than the end of the array. If a seat is empty, then add one to the number of seats in current empty region. If it is full then break
    - return (start index of longest + (number of seats in longest-1) / 2)
  - static void printArray requires one argument: array of booleans
    - iterates through the array and prints "X " if true or "_ " if false
