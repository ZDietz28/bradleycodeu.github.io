In your tester class ([tester template here](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/e368f4b498)) you will…

1. instantiate 2 or more customers (different membership levels)
1. instantiate multiple dogs (some with shot records and some without) and associate them with the customers that own them
1. instantiate multiple items
1. output a list of items that are low stock
1. output a list of items that are past their sell-by date
1. instantiate 2 or more appointments (some successful and some that will generate output such as “Star Members can make item purchases only, no appointments” and “That appointment time is not available” and “A valid shot record is required to schedule that appointment”)
1. create a shopping cart with multiple items and output:
  - the individual prices for all items
  - the total price for the shopping cart (don’t worry about tax)
  - EITHER the amount of star points earned this sale OR the amount of cash back earned this sale
  - EITHER the total amount of star points OR the total amount of cash back for this customer (you MUST create a second purchase in order to accurately test this)
