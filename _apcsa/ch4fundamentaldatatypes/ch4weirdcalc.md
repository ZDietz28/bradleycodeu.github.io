Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints

  1. The sum
  1. The difference
  1. The product
  1. The average
  1. The distance (absolute value of the difference)
  1. The maximum (the larger of the two)
  1. The minimum (the smaller of the two)

<small>Hint: The abs, max, and min functions are declared in the Math class.</small>

USE PRINTF so that the numbers are properly aligned. I want the output to look EXACTLY like this:

Example Output:
```
Enter your first number: 19
Enter your second number: 20

Sum:                39
Difference:         -1
Product:           380
Average:            19.50
Distance:            1
Maximum:            20
Minimum:            19
```
